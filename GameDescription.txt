# Game Description

It's Halloween night and you're fresh out of things to do.  Rumour on the street is that there is a Haunted House just outside of the city limits with a Candy Stash buried deep in the foundations.  Well, in the basement.  You decide to make the most of your night and head out to find the house and its candy stash.  Besides, Ghosts aren't real, right?

What you come to discover is that this assumption will prove to be a dangerous one.  You have to trust a Ghost in order to get to your candy prize!  He seems friendly enough, but you can tell that he's hiding something.  Is it the candy, or something darker?
